Introduction to Git and GitHub

I'm learning to use this site thanks to the GitHub guide.
I'll be learning Python and other programming languages in my free time.

I am a digital consultant and I mainly create websites based on WordPress.

Now, These are my main reasons to keep learning how to code:
- The idea of coding sounds fun for me.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- I want to make a web app for my clients to schedule an appointment with me, send their comments about a project and been able to pay the service with a credit card.
- I do pentesting but with coding I'll be able to better manage the tools for it.
